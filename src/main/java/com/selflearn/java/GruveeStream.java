                // He explains the architecture of the project, he wants to do a native wrapper, having a swift and android shell both having a react native view
                // it also contains creating a playlist and sharing

                //Features of app:
                // every person needs an account
                // creating a playlist
                // the account should be created via the app or social media(name becomes music social media app)
                // people can create or join a playlist through an invite system
                // adding songs, by a link from a music provider(apple music,spotify,youtube, etc)

                //how to create the app:
                // plans to use a native shell with react native inside to flesh out/create the app
                // NOTE: an app shell is the part of an app that doesn't change
                // you stopped at timestamp 22:44
